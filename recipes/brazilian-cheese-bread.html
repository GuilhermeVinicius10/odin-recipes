        <br>
        <h3><u>Ingredients:</u></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup whole milk </li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
            <li>2 cups tapioca flour </li>
            <li>2 eggs </li>
            <li>3/4 cup Parmesan cheese </li>
            <li>3/4 cup sharp or medium cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3><u>Instructions:</u></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400-degrees</li>
            <br>
            <li>Put all the ingredients except the cheese in a blender.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Blend until smooth (about 20 seconds) then scrape the sides of the blender.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add cheese and pulse 3-4 times to incorporate.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Spray a mini muffin pan with cooking spray and fill each cup with the cheese mixture until almost full.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Place in the oven and bake 15-20 minutes or until the outside of the rolls are golden brown and puffed up. Do not over bake! The texture on the outside is more dry and “bread” like and the inside is more soft and chewy.
            </li>
                
            
            
        </ol>

Odin Project Foundations Course - HTML Foundations - Recipes

# Thoughts
This is the first project from the course Odin Project, it's the last task
from the HTML Foundations module, where i learned basic HTML language syntax. 

In this project i made a page containing recipes from the country Brazil,
two were desserts (carrot cake and pudding) and one snack (cheese bread).

In order to finish the project i had to use all the main HTML elements that was teach during the module: links, image, lists elements, header, paragraph. 

By the end of the project i felt more confident about the use of HTML language basic elements.
